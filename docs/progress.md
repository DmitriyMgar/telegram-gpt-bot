### 2. Database Implementation
- ✅ SQLite schema: `user_analytics` table with user_id, username, request_date, tokens_used
- ✅ Automated database initialization and table creation
- ✅ Performance indexes on user_id, request_date, and composite keys
- ✅ Data validation and sanitization
- ✅ Graceful handling of database errors

### 3. OpenAI API Integration (`openai_handler.py`)
- ✅ Modified `send_message_and_get_response()` to extract token usage data
- ✅ Integrated token counting from OpenAI API response (`usage.total_tokens`)
- ✅ Added username parameter for better user tracking
- ✅ Implemented fallback handling when token data is unavailable

### 4. Bot Integration (`main.py`)
- ✅ Integrated analytics initialization in bot startup
- ✅ Added `get_username()` utility function for consistent user identification
- ✅ Modified message handler to pass username to OpenAI handler
- ✅ Fixed event loop conflicts with Telegram Bot API
- ✅ Implemented graceful shutdown with analytics cleanup

### 5. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Added `ANALYTICS_DB_PATH` environment variable to `config.py`
- ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` with `aiosqlite==0.20.0` dependency
- ✅ Set default database path to `./data/user_analytics.db`
- ✅ Created `data/` directory for database storage

### 6. Analytics Functions Implemented
- ✅ `record_usage()` - Record token consumption per user/date
- ✅ `get_user_daily_usage()` - Daily consumption by user
- ✅ `get_user_total_usage()` - Total consumption by user
- ✅ `get_all_users_usage_by_date()` - All users consumption for specific date
- ✅ `get_user_usage_stats()` - Extended user statistics with daily breakdown

### 7. Analytics Viewing Tool (`view_analytics.py`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive analytics viewing script
- ✅ Implemented multiple viewing modes: all data, users, daily, info
- ✅ Added command-line interface with help system
- ✅ Built formatted data display with proper table layouts
- ✅ Integrated database connection and error handling

## 🎯 Key Features Delivered

1. **Privacy-First Design**: No message content stored, only metadata and token counts
2. **Efficient Storage**: SQLite with optimized indexes for fast queries
3. **Async Architecture**: Non-blocking database operations
4. **Error Resilience**: Bot continues working even if analytics fails
5. **Comprehensive Tracking**: User identification, date-based aggregation, token counting
6. **Future-Ready**: Extensible design for additional analytics features

## 📁 New Files Created

- **`user_analytics.py`** - Core analytics module with UserAnalytics class
- **`view_analytics.py`** - Analytics viewing tool with multiple display modes
- **`data/user_analytics.db`** - SQLite database file (auto-generated)

## 📊 Data Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_analytics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    username TEXT,
    request_date DATE NOT NULL,
    tokens_used INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Database**: SQLite with async operations via `aiosqlite`
- **Storage Location**: `./data/user_analytics.db` (configurable)
- **Token Extraction**: From OpenAI API `usage.total_tokens` field
- **User Identification**: Telegram username, first name, or fallback ID
- **Date Tracking**: Daily aggregation with ISO date format

## 🛠️ Deployment & Troubleshooting

### Deployment Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Installed dependency: `aiosqlite==0.20.0`
2. ✅ Added `ANALYTICS_DB_PATH=./data/user_analytics.db` to configuration
3. ✅ Created `data/` directory for database storage
4. ✅ Resolved event loop conflicts with Telegram Bot API
5. ✅ Fixed bot startup issues and duplicate process conflicts
6. ✅ Verified database initialization and schema creation

### Issues Resolved:
- ✅ **Event Loop Conflicts**: Fixed asyncio conflicts between analytics initialization and Telegram Bot API
- ✅ **Duplicate Bot Processes**: Identified and resolved conflicts from multiple bot instances
- ✅ **Database Initialization**: Ensured proper async database setup during bot startup
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Properly installed all required packages in virtual environment

### Analytics Viewing Commands:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# View all analytics data
python view_analytics.py

# View user statistics only
python view_analytics.py users

# View daily statistics only  
python view_analytics.py daily

# View database info only
python view_analytics.py info

# Show help
python view_analytics.py help
```

### Direct SQL Access:
```bash
# Install sqlite3 if needed
apt install sqlite3

# Access database directly
sqlite3 data/user_analytics.db

# Example queries:
SELECT * FROM user_analytics ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT user_id, username, SUM(tokens_used) FROM user_analytics GROUP BY user_id;
```
